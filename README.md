### **🚀 Key Features**

#### **🛠️ High-Concurrency Load Testing**
- Simulate up to **500 concurrent requests** to your server or application.
- Stress-test your server with high-concurrency traffic to evaluate its performance under heavy load.
- Supports both **GET** and **POST** HTTP methods for comprehensive testing.

#### **📊 Real-Time Monitoring and Progress Updates**
- View **real-time updates** on the progress of the test, including the number of requests sent, successes, and failures.
- Track **response times**, **status codes**, and **request counts** during the test with a live progress bar.

#### **🔍 Advanced Analytics & Reporting**
- Get detailed analytics after each test, including average, maximum, and minimum response times.
- Analyze server performance with **percentile breakdowns** (50th, 75th, 90th, 95th, 99th, and 99.9th percentiles).
- Save all results in a **CSV report** for post-test analysis.

#### **🔐 Error Handling and Logging**
- Automatically retry failed requests up to a configurable number of times to ensure accuracy.
- Comprehensive **error logs** are saved to a `.log` file for troubleshooting and deeper analysis.

#### **🔄 Load Pattern Flexibility**
- Configure and test different load patterns to simulate real-world scenarios.
- Customizable rate-limiting to avoid overwhelming the server too quickly.

#### **📈 Detailed Status Code Distribution**
- Track all status codes returned by the server (e.g., 200, 400, 500) and analyze the server's response patterns under load.
